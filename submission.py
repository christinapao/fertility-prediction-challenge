"""
This is an example script to generate the outcome variable given the input dataset.

This script should be modified to prepare your own submission that predicts 
the outcome for the benchmark challenge by changing the clean_df and predict_outcomes function.

The predict_outcomes function takes a Pandas data frame. The return value must
be a data frame with two columns: nomem_encr and outcome. The nomem_encr column
should contain the nomem_encr column from the input data frame. The outcome
column should contain the predicted outcome for each nomem_encr. The outcome
should be 0 (no child) or 1 (having a child).

clean_df should be used to clean (preprocess) the data.

run.py can be used to test your submission.

    The predict_outcomes function accepts a Pandas DataFrame as an argument

    corresponding column from the input DataFrame. The prediction

    prediction is represented as a binary value: '0' indicates that the
